====

### Current status

* Development is ongoing via the core-protocol-v3.0-dev branch in the
  [zarr-specs repo](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs),
  follow
  [PR#16](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/pull/16) for
  current status.

* Rendered docs from this branch can be [viewed on
  RTFD](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/).

* This is still a straw man, everything is up for discussion.

====

### Design principles

1. Hackable
2. Parallel
3. Distributed

===

### Hackable

* Easy to implement
* Easy to extend with new functionality
* Easy to inspect and manipulate data with generic tools

===

### Parallel

* Think "what happens if two workers do X at the same time"?
* Avoid race conditions

===

### Distributed

* Accommodate eventual consistency

====

### Modular spec architecture

* [Core protocol spec](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html)
* [Protocol extension specs](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/extensions.html)
* Codec specs
* Storage specs

===

### [Core protocol spec](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html)

* Minimal, easy as possible to do full implementation in any language.
 
* Aiming for intersection of N5 and Zarr v2 features.

* Defines a variety of **extension points** so can also serve as a
  foundation for growth and experimentation.

===

### Protocol extension specs

* Each protocol extension gets its own spec.

* Currently the core-protocol-v3.0-dev branch also includes some
  protocol extension specs, to illustrate the concept.
  
  * E.g., [Datetime data types
    spec](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/extensions/datetime-dtypes/v1.0.html)

* Ultimately these extension specs should get split out each into a
  separate development branch, so we decouple them from the core
  protocol spec.

===

### Codec specs

* Each codec intended for use as a compressor or filter gets it's own
  spec.
  
* @@TODO create an example to illustrate the concept.

===

### Storage specs

* Each concrete storage system (e.g., file system, cloud object
  storage, Zip file, LMDB, ...) gets it's own spec.

* @@TODO create an example to illustrate the concept.

====

### Spec development process - current

* Currently @alimanfoo is acting as editor for the v3.0 core protocol
  spec.

  * Feedback/comments/ideas welcome from anyone at any time
    ([PR#16](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/pull/16) is
    probably the best place for comments).
	
  * Still in a conceptualisation phase, no need for formal decision
    process as yet.

===

### Spec development process - future?

* Ultimately I think we'll need to define a community process for spec
  development, so that:
  
  * It's clear how others can contribute.
  
  * It's clear how decisions get made.
  
  * It's clear what stage of maturity each spec is at.
  
* Don't have a solution for that yet, may need advice/help on best
  approach.

===

### Spec development process - freedoms

* Hopefully the [zarr-specs
  repo](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs) can serve as a
  focus for community spec development.
  
  * ...and the [zarr-specs RTFD
    site](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io) can serve as a discovery
    point for specs.
  
* However, don't want to force all spec development down the same
  route, or force all specs to be published in the same place.
  
  * This is one reason why currently the core protocol spec makes use
    of **URIs** in metadata to refer to protocol extensions and
    codecs - allow freedom for anyone to publish their own spec.

====

### [Core protocol - concepts and terminology](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html#concepts-and-terminology)

*Hierachy. Group. Array. Name. Path. Dimension. Shape. Element. Data
type. Chunk. Grid. Memory layout. Compressor. Codec. Metadata
document. Store.*

* Are we comfortable with this terminology and how it is defined?

* Any important missing terms/concepts?

====

### [Core protocol - node names](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html#node-names)

* Each node (array or group) in a hierarchy has a name.

* Node names are used to form node paths.

  * E.g., "/foo/bar" is a path identifying a node named "bar" whose
    parent is named "foo" whose parent is the root node.

===

### Node names - restrictions

* Node paths are used by users to access nodes and explore/navigate a
  hierarchy.

* N.B., node paths are also used to form storage keys (see later).

* To try and ensure compatibility with a variety of storage systems,
  the core protocol currently states fairly heavy
  [restrictions](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html#node-names)
  on node names.
  
  * Includes restriction to ASCII alpha-numeric characters, "-", "_"
    and ".".

===

### Node names - restrictions

* Are we comfortable with the current restrictions? 

* Should we be aiming to support Unicode? Or is that a bridge too far
  for now?

  * Not sure what full implications would be, but supporting Unicode
    could make storage specs and implementations harder to develop.

===

### Node names - case (in)sensitivity

* N.B., some file systems are case sensitive, some are not.

* This can ([and
  has](https://github.com/cggh/scikit-allel/issues/215#issuecomment-434088283))
  led to bugs with the zarr v2 protocol when used with file system
  storage on different operating systems.
  
* Hard to resolve without annoying users (e.g., force all names to
  lower case) or increasing implementation complexity (e.g., check for
  case-insensitive name clashes).
  
* I'm not happy with the spec's current approach to this.

====

### [Core protocol - data types](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html#id5)

* Boolean (single byte)

* Integer (signed or unsigned; 1, 2, 4, 8 bytes; little- or
  big-endian)

* Float (2, 4, 8 bytes; little- or big-endian)

* Any other data type can be defined via a protocol extension

  * E.g., [datetime data
    types](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/extensions/datetime-dtypes/v1.0.html)

===

### Data types - identifiers

* Each data type needs an identifier for use in metadata documents.

* E.g., "bool", "i1", "<i4", ">u8", "<f2", etc.

====

### Core protocol - chunk grids

* A chunk grid defines a set of chunks which contain the elements of an array.

* The chunks of a grid form a tessellation of the array space, which
  is a space defined by the dimensionality and shape of the array.

  * => Every element of the array is a member of one chunk, and there
    are no gaps or overlaps between chunks.

===

### Grid types

* In general there are several different possible types of grid.

* The core protocol defines [regular
  grids](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html#regular-grids).
  
* Other grid types can be defined via protocol extensions.

* Any grid type must define:

  * How the array space is divided into chunks.
  
  * A unique identifier for each chunk in the grid (used to form
    storage keys, see later).

===

### [Regular grids](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html#regular-grids)

* Grid type where each chunk is a (hyper)rectangle of the same shape.

* I.e., grid type used in HDF5 and Zarr v2.

* Each chunk has a grid index, which is a tuple of grid coordinates.

  * E.g., grid index (0, 3, 7) means first chunk along first
    dimension, fourth chunk along second dimension, 8th chunk along
    third dimension.

===

### Regular grids - chunk identifiers

* Chunk identifier is formed from grid index.

  * E.g., chunk at grid index (0, 3, 7) has identifier "0.3.7".
  
* Default separator is "." but can be changed (e.g., to "/") in array
  metadata (see later).

===

### Regular grids - edge chunks

* All chunks have the same shape.

* If the length of any array dimension is not perfectly divisible by
  the chunk length along the same dimension, the grid will overhang
  the edge of the array space.
  
* Spec currently doesn't say any more about how to handle edge chunks,
  maybe it should?

  * E.g., suggest using array fill value to fill contents of edge
    chunks beyond the array space.
	
* Other approaches (e.g., truncated edge chunks) could be defined as a
  different grid type via a protocol extension.

===

### Regular grids - resizing arrays

* Regular grid supports growing and shrinking an array along any
  dimension.

  * Growing only requires change to array metadata (update array
    shape), no chunk data needs to be added or modified.
	
  * Shrinking requires change to array metadata (update array shape)
    plus delete any chunks now completely outside the array space.
	
* Regular grid does not support growing an array in "negative"
  direction, i.e., prepending.
  
  * But could define a grid type that does support this via a protocol
    extension.
